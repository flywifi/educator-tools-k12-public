description: "Transform documents — PDF, DOCX, HTML, TXT, images/scans, and Google Workspace (Docs API JSON + .odt/.csv/.xlsx/.pptx exports) — into GOVERNED, reusable knowledge assets via a parser-independent, artifact-centric pipeline (ingest → recover/OCR → structure/tables → govern → knowledge → artifact). Use whenever someone needs to read, parse, extract, OCR, or structure a document WITH provenance/lineage/confidence — e.g. 'read this PDF properly', 'extract the tables', 'OCR this scan', or 'read this Google Doc/Sheet/Slides'. Produces governed knowledge/consumer artifacts; emits the metadata block (protocols/metadata-schema.md) with human_review_required: true; gated by quality-review. Do NOT use it to author NEW instructional content (use lesson-planner/assessment-designer/etc.), to crawl/fetch from the web or Google Drive (that is standards-updater / a connector), or as a search engine / vector database. Never fabricates: unrecovered regions are reported with low confidence, never invented."

# document-intelligence

Turns documents into **governed knowledge assets** — structured, provenance-tracked, machine- and
human-consumable artifacts — so the rest of the ecosystem consumes *artifacts*, not raw source files.
It is **parser-independent** (parsers/OCR engines are swappable plugins) and **artifact-centric**
(artifacts are the durable product). Canonical engine: `shared/docintel/` (the source of truth).

**Five principles** (do not violate): Knowledge-First · Governance-First · Evidence-First ·
Parser-Independence · Artifact-Centric. See `references/docintel-architecture.md`.

> **Boundaries (read first).** This skill *reads and structures* documents you already have; it does
> **not** fetch them from the web or Google Drive — discovery/crawling is `standards-updater`, and
> Drive/Docs API access (OAuth/network) is a separate connector. Bring the exported file or the Docs
> API JSON. It **never fabricates** content: anything that cannot be recovered (e.g., a scan with no
> OCR engine installed) is reported with low/zero confidence and a capability-gap note, never guessed.
> Outputs are decision support.

## What this skill does
Runs the document-processing pipeline and emits governed artifacts:
```
Ingestion → Recovery (text/OCR) → Structure (reading-order/layout/tables)
          → Governance → Knowledge Construction → Artifact Generation → Consumer Delivery
```
Governance metadata (provenance, lineage, confidence, evidence) survives every stage; raw extraction
never bypasses governance; artifacts are the only consumer-facing outputs.

## How it works — the unified pipeline
Follow the shared pipeline in `references/method.md`. The domain work runs through the docintel
engine (`shared/docintel/`):
```bash
python3 tools/docintel_run.py --check                      # list parsers + availability (offline)
python3 tools/docintel_run.py <file> --out artifact.json --udom udom.json
# Capture-now, parse-later: register an upload for deferred parsing, then process the batch when ready
python3 tools/docintel_run.py <upload> --enqueue --queue inbox_queue   # register only (no parse yet)
python3 tools/docintel_run.py --process-queue --queue inbox_queue      # parse all pending uploads now
```
- **Recovery** — the orchestrator selects a parser by *capability*, not by name
  (`shared/docintel/parser-orchestration.md`). Stdlib-only by default (.txt/.md/.html/.docx); PDF
  support activates automatically when PyMuPDF is installed; add Docling/Surya/Camelot/etc. as new
  plugins with **no consumer changes**.
- **Resilient HTML** — uploaded/saved HTML routes to `resilient_html`, which prefers Scrapling's
  parser / lxml for robust extraction of messy or restructured pages and **falls back to stdlib
  automatically** (always runs; records which engine actually ran). Parser only — no fetching, no
  anti-bot evasion. The optional Scrapling/lxml wheels install via `tools/deps_preflight.py`; absent
  them, stdlib still parses, just less robustly.
- **Deferred parsing** — when someone uploads a document, you can parse it immediately *or* capture it
  now and parse it **separately / at a later time** via the `--enqueue` / `--process-queue` queue
  above. A queued item is registered honestly (content hash + media type, `retrieval_state:
  referenced`) and only becomes `content_ingested` once actually parsed; an item needing an absent
  optional parser stays queued with an honest status rather than being faked.
- **Recursive / nested documents** — `--recursive` parses documents *contained inside* the upload:
  a `.zip` of reports, an `.eml`'s attachments, or an OOXML file that **embeds** another (e.g. a
  `.pptx` pulled from a download link that itself embeds an `.xlsx`). It builds a depth-bounded tree
  with a content-hash cycle guard. (Following a *web* download link to fetch the linked file is the
  harvest layer's job — `tools/acquire.py`; those fetched files then feed this pipeline.)
- **Internationalization** — text is decoded encoding-aware (BOM → declared/`<meta charset>` →
  detector → UTF-8 → Latin-1), never `utf-8/ignore`, then NFC-normalized — so non-Latin scripts
  (CJK, Arabic, Cyrillic…), legacy system encodings (Windows-1252, Shift-JIS, Mac Roman, ISO-8859-*),
  and the full range of special characters and language punctuation are preserved, not mangled. PDF
  glyph→Unicode is handled by PyMuPDF; scanned foreign text needs the matching tesseract language pack
  (see `tools/deps_preflight.py`).
- **Structure** — reading order, headings, and tables into the UDOM
  (`shared/docintel/udom.md` + `udom.schema.json`).
- **Governance** — provenance/lineage/confidence/evidence on every object
  (`shared/docintel/governance-contract.md`); ties to `protocol-layer/metadata-schema.md`.
- **Validation** — accuracy/governance/reusability metrics (`shared/docintel/validation-framework.md`);
  staged metrics are reported honestly as `staged`, never faked.
- **Quality** — self-check against `references/quality-gates.md`, then hand to `quality-review`.

## Experimental features & feature flags
Experimental pipeline stages default **OFF** and are opt-in via `PipelineConfig.flags`
(see `shared/docintel/orchestration.py`). This keeps new/experimental recovery modes isolated until
validated — flip a flag per run/environment without affecting the default governed path. Required
recovery capabilities are likewise configurable via `PipelineConfig.required_capabilities`.

## Artifacts
See `references/artifact-types.md`: `processed-document-record`, `udom-document`, `recovery-report`,
`structure-map`, `governance-record`, `knowledge-artifact`, `consumer-artifact`.

## Output: always emit the metadata block
Every artifact ends with the metadata block from `protocol-layer/metadata-schema.md`, including the
validation `score_summary` and `human_review_required: true` — outputs are decision support, not
final professional or legal determinations, and nothing is "certified" until it passes the Quality
Gates via `quality-review`. Use placeholders only; never real student data or PII.
