# report-card-comment

Generates one standards-based report card comment with growth language, aligned to grade-level expectations. Uses placeholder data only — never real student data.

## Input

```json
{
  "student_name": "[Student Name]",
  "grade": "3",
  "subject": "Math",
  "standard_codes": ["MA.3.NSO.1.1", "MA.3.NSO.1.2"],
  "placeholder_performance": "approaching grade level in place value; meets expectations in addition/subtraction",
  "tone": "encouraging"
}
```

## Output

```json
{
  "tool": "report-card-comment",
  "comment": "[Student Name] is making steady progress in mathematics. [He/She/They] demonstrates solid understanding of addition and subtraction strategies and is building confidence with place value concepts. Next steps include practicing representing numbers in different forms (standard, expanded, word). Keep up the great effort!",
  "standards_referenced": ["MA.3.NSO.1.1", "MA.3.NSO.1.2"],
  "human_review_required": true
}
```

- Using real student data (placeholders only)
