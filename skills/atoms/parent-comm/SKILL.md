# parent-comm

Drafts a single parent/guardian communication. Supports email, paper note, and short text-message summary formats. The tone is warm, professional, and jargon-free. No student PII — uses placeholders ([Student Name], [Parent/Guardian]).

## Input

```json
{
  "purpose": "upcoming_unit | behavior_concern | progress_update | event_reminder | celebration | general_info",
  "grade": "4",
  "subject": "Math",
  "teacher_notes": "We are starting our fractions unit next week. Students will need 2 pencils and a ruler.",
  "tone": "warm_professional | formal | friendly_casual",
  "format": "email | paper_note | text_summary",
  "language": "English",
  "include_call_to_action": true
}
```

`purpose`: drives the template structure. `teacher_notes`: key facts/details the teacher wants included. `language`: English by default; specify Spanish, Portuguese, Haitian Creole, etc. for a translated draft.
