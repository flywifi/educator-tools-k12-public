# intervention-select

Suggests an evidence-based intervention matched to a student need and MTSS tier, with implementation notes (frequency, duration, group size). Never fabricates program names or citations.

> **Read first — boundaries (`security/SECURITY_AND_SAFETY.md` §2, §5).** An intervention match is
> **decision support for the MTSS or problem-solving team**, not a placement, a tier assignment, or
> an eligibility determination — **MTSS is not special-education eligibility**, and a tier-3 match
> here neither implies nor initiates a referral. It must be validated against the **actual**
> district-adopted programs available to that student and against local policy. Program names and
> research citations are **never fabricated**: return an honest gap instead of a plausible-sounding
> program (`protocol-layer/standards-verification.md`). **Never request, infer, or include real
> student data — placeholders only.**

## Input

```json
{
  "need": "below grade level in reading fluency",
  "tier": 2,
  "grade": "3",
  "subject": "Reading"
}
```

## Output

```json
{
  "tool": "intervention-select",
  "intervention": {
    "approach": "Repeated reading with corrective feedback",
    "tier": 2,
    "frequency": "3x per week, 20 minutes",
    "group_size": "3-5 students",
    "duration_weeks": "8-12 weeks before review",
    "evidence_note": "Repeated reading is supported by the What Works Clearinghouse for improving fluency in elementary grades",
    "progress_monitoring": "ORF probes biweekly"
  },
  "human_review_required": true
}
```

## Do NOT use this atom for
- Fabricating specific program names or research citations
- Tier 3 interventions without IEP team involvement
- Replacing MTSS team decision-making
- Using real student data

## Pipeline note
Follows `references/method.md` at the Generation step (intervention matching). Output conforms to `protocol-layer/metadata-schema.md`. `human_review_required: true` — intervention selection must be confirmed by the MTSS/IEP team.
