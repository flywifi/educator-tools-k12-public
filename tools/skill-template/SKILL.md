# __SKILL_NAME__

## What this skill does
REPLACE with a one-paragraph overview of the capability and its artifacts.

## How it works — the unified pipeline
Follow the shared pipeline in `references/method.md`
(`Request → Routing → Protocol Enforcement → Generation → Validation → Quality Gates →
Approval/Certification → Release`). The domain work happens in Generation:
`Analysis → Standards Alignment → Differentiation → Generation`.

- **Standards** — select + cite verifiable standards (`references/` standards material;
  `protocols/standards-verification.md`). Never fabricate a standard.
- **Differentiation** — apply UDL by default, plus tiering / EL / IEP supports as relevant.
- **Quality** — self-check against `references/quality-gates.md`, then hand to `quality-review`.

## Artifacts
See `references/artifact-types.md` for the artifact types this skill produces and their specs.

## Output: always emit the metadata block
Every artifact ends with the metadata block from `protocols/metadata-schema.md`, including the
per-dimension quality scores, the decision, and `human_review_required: true` — outputs are
decision support, not final professional or legal determinations. Use placeholders only; never real
student data.
